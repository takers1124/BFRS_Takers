#### using Dada2 ####

(1) use Dada2 to perform sequence QC and construct the feature table
      # as in this tutorial
        # https://docs.qiime2.org/2023.9/tutorials/moving-pictures/#option-1-dada2

qiime dada2 denoise-paired \
  --i-demultiplexed-seqs paired-end-demux.qza \
  --p-trunc-len-f 220 \
  --p-trunc-len-r 220 \
  --o-representative-sequences asv-sequences.qza \
  --o-table feature-table.qza \
  --o-denoising-stats dada2-stats.qza

      # I used 220 as the threshold based on the interactive quality plot for [demux.qzv] visualized with qiime2view
          # 220 is the avg sequence length, and quality appears to be consistant throughout 

      # feature-table.qza = FeatureTable[Frequency] -> count (frequency) of each unique squ in ea sample
      # asv-sequences.qza = FeatureTable[Sequence] -> maps feature identifiers to the sequences they represent

(2) visualize the QC stats (after removing "noisy" sequences

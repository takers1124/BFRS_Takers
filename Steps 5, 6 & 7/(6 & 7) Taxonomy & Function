#### (6) assign taxonomy to ASVs  ####

#1 Using UNITE database to assign fungal taxonomy to ASVs
    # Note, UNITE is for ITS loci only
    # I used a pre-trained UNITE database, found on QIIME forum
        # https://forum.qiime2.org/t/pre-trained-unite-its-classifiers-for-qiime-2024-5-and-older/24140
		# Didn't work the first time, but after adding "--p-n-jobs -1" - it worked!
        # This allocated computing power differently
        # I still had to use a remote server (AWS) because my computer did not have enough compute power to run this
    # I created a new directory (and was in it) with the to input files below

qiime feature-classifier classify-sklearn --p-n-jobs -1 \
  --i-classifier unite_ver9_dynamic_25.07.2023-Q2-2023.9.qza \

#### (7) assign functinoal information to taxa ####

# Using FunGuild, but need to format data first.
      # https://github.com/UMNFuN/FUNGuild
          # See ex data file and match format.
      
#1 download Guilds_v1.1.py file (whatever version is available)

#2 transpose FeatureTable[Frequency] (file name: feature-table.qza) in Excel
      # Convert .qza to .qzv, view feature-table.qzv, export as .csv, open in Excel
      # Needed ASVs as rows & column headers as samples
          # Tried in QIIME but had errors
      # saved file (feature-table-transposed.txt)

#3 merge transposed FeatureTable[Frequency] & taxonomy table (taxonomy.qza)
      # I had an issue because the default column heading for ASV code names in taxonomy.qza did not match the column heading in my frequency table
          # I converted taxonomy.qza to .qzv, view taxonomy.qzv, export as .csv, open in Ecel, change heading
              # and saved new modified file (metadata_tax.tsv)

qiime metadata tabulate \
 --m-input-file feature-table-transposed.txt \
 --m-input-file metadata_tax.tsv \
 --o-visualization combined-taxonomy-frequ.qzv

 #4 View .qzv, export as .csv and convert to .txt

 #5 run FunGuild code
       # be in a directory with the 2 files below
       # be sure the Guild file version in code is same version as downloaded file
       # I added -m & -u for more info

 python Guilds_v1.1.py -otu combined-tax-frequ.txt -db fungi -m -u

	# exported file name (combined-tax-frequ.guilds.txt)
		# I opened this in Excel and saved as .csv for use in R

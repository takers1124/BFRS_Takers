##### basic shell functions #####

# start by opening your command line interface (Windows = CMD, Mac = Terminal)
# find out which shell program is running as default

echo $0
echo$SHELL

# if you see "bash" or "/bin/bash" as the output, good. If not, try running this:

chsh -s /bin/bash

# then quit terminal/CMD and reopen, rerun echo. See bash? Good!

##### conda & QIIME2 install #####

# Here are the main instructions for installing QIIME2
# https://docs.qiime2.org/2024.5/install/native/

# However, I could not get it to work with miniconda, so I used miniforge3
# https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge

# I clicked the blue link to download miniforge3 to my computer
# then, I used bash to install (replace the version of miniforge for your architecture - exactly as file name of download) 

  bash Miniforge3-MacOSX-arm64.sh

# after install, test

  conda info

# then use QIIME2 instal code ONLY for the amplicon distribution (for your architecture)

  CONDA_SUBDIR=osx-64 conda env create -n qiime2-amplicon-2024.5 --file https://data.qiime2.org/distro/amplicon/qiime2-amplicon-2024.5-py39-osx-conda.yml

# then activate
  
  conda activate qiime2-amplicon-2024.5

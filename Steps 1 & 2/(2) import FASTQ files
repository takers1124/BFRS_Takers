(1) when starting, always check conda is functioning properly

conda info

(2) then, activate QIIME2 environment (replace with version you're using)

conda activate qiime2-amplicon-2023.9         
      # or qiime2-amplicon-2024.5

(3) now, use the most regularly used commands to navigate in your working dorectory and make a new folder on your desktop

pwd             # this will show your present working directory (pwd - aka, a folder)     
                # Ex: /Users/taylorakers        or     C:\User\Glenn
                # meaning, you are presently in the home user directory for your computer
ls              # this will list (ls) all the items in the current directory
                # you should see Documents, Downloads, Music, ETC, and most important for us, Desktop
cd Desktop      # this will change directory (cd) that you're operating in
                # in this case, now you're operating in your Desktop
mkdir BFRS      # this will make a directory (mkdir) in your Desktop, and it must be given a name
                # in this case, we'll call it BFRS
                # this is where we will do all of our work
cd BFRS         # move into it
mkdir import    # new directory called import inside BFRS

(4) now take a moment to minimize your command line prompt, zoom screen, etc to see your Desktop visually 
      # do you see your new BFRS folder? And inside there's an import folder? 
      # go ahead and download & drop the 2 files I've shared with you in there (we're doing this manually)
                # raw_cut_BFRS            - these are the 72 FASTQ files
                # bfrs-manifest.tsv       - this file guides the computer to the location of the FASTQ files


#### import ####
      # import FASTQ files using a manifest file format
      # https://docs.qiime2.org/2024.5/tutorials/importing/#fastq-manifest-formats
      # note, you must be in the directory with the above 2 files (ex: pwd = /Desktop/BFRS/import)

(1) import

qiime tools import \
  --type 'SampleData[PairedEndSequencesWithQuality]' \
  --input-path bfrs-manifest.tsv \
  --output-path paired-end-demux.qza \                      
  --input-format PairedEndFastqManifestPhred33V2

      # bfrs-manifest = the .tsv you downloaded with the location of each FASTQ listed
      # paired-end-demux.qza = the output file (72 FASTQ files conferted to 1 .qza file)
          # you can see this visually in your import folder!

(2) create sequence QC vizualisation (demultiplexed sequences)

qiime demux summarize \
  --i-data paired-end-demux.qza \
  --o-visualization demux.qzv                           
    
      # this is our first visualization
          # you can see this file visually in your import folder!

(3) view it
      # drag .qzv file from your import folder on your desktop into QIIME2 VIEW
      # https://view.qiime2.org/
      # for this visualization, you can see info on 2 tabs (top left)
          # overview - number of reads 
          # interactive quality plot - quality of reads

(4) interpret quality
      # using the interactive quality plot, you can determine where the sequences will be truncated in the nest step (using Dada2)
      # these dequences all have good quality!
          # all have a score above 25
